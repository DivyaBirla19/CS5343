The program requires a minimum of 15 input values from the user to begin sorting.It asks the user the list size and allows user to provide data as per the size mentioned(>=15).
The user inputs are entered at the head of the single linked list.
A function is used to find the minimum in the list and then pass the head of the list, minimum found, node before the minimum to another function which helps delink and relink nodes as per the required ascending order sort.
