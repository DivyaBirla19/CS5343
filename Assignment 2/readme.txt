Files included:

BSTInorder.cpp 	-conatins the source code
BSTInorder.exe		-executable file for the code

The program intialises a list with 15 integers values as nodes of the graph. These integers are passed as an array to the insertion function.
Inorder traversal of the 15 nodes is carried out and then the following nodes are deleted and replaced by their predecessor:50,40,65,35.
Function FindPred is used to find the predecessor of node to be deleted.
Please find attached screenshots of the tree struture as per each deletion:
1.BST insertion and In-order Traversal
2.Deletion of 50,40,63 and 35.
